# Jon’s Aphorisms

The following are some of the aphorisms Jonathan Callahan often uses along with 
his interpretation of them. They are included here to capture the spirit of how Dr. 
Callahan sees the role of software development with respect to academic science.

-----

## _Science should be open, transparent and reproducible._

Publicly funded science should be open source, easily understood by the public 
and completely reproducible with freely available tools. Period. Part of my 
personal mission is to make this increasingly true for the end users of software
I have been involved with. One aspect of this is open source licensing.

## _Clear writing is clear thinking._

Thinking and writing are two sides of the same coin. If you can’t express your 
thoughts clearly in writing then your thoughts probably aren’t that clear.

Write words first, code second.

## _Communication should be clear, concise and correct._

I have learned many, many times over the years that the additional time spent 
crafting a message that is clear, concise and correct, even for email and Slack, 
ends up saving time in the long run by reducing confusion.

Use punctuation and spell check.

## _Spend 1/4 of your time reading, 1/4 thinking, 1/4 writing code and 1/4 testing._

Part of the joy of writing R code is that we get to stand on the shoulders of 
giants. Many people providing packages are way smarter than me and new packages 
come out every week. It is important to stay up-to-date by following 
[r-bloggers.com](https://www.r-bloggers.com/) and to google for solutions before 
diving in. Many of the problems I have encountered are not unique and someone 
may have already solved them. Don’t reinvent the wheel.

## _Write code for your future self._

I always try to write consistent, even pedantic coding style because I want code 
to be understandable by myself. In two or five years in the future I may have zero 
idea what I was thinking when the code was originally written. This is 
one of those things that requires some extended work experience to really appreciate.

## _Software stages:  Proof-of-concept -- working prototype -- operational system_

These are the three stages I think of for software development. Unfortunately, 
much of academia only gets as far as _proof-of-concept_. Even in government 
agency settings I have often run up against folks who think that a 
_working prototype_ is ready to be used operationally. It is a fact of life that 
the _operational systems_ that agencies want require significant additional effort
beyond _working prototype_.

## _Our job is to make other people’s jobs easier._

Developers of R packages should have in mind a target audience of data analyst 
professionals who are smart and technically capable, but who may not know R very 
well and probably don’t consider themselves "coders”. Truly useful packages should 
provide an enjoyable user experience that makes _“the easy invisible, the hard 
easy and the impossible possible”_.

Analyzing data should be fun.

## _Your eyes are the best statistical analysis tools you will ever use._

I am a big fan of data visualization and am always perusing places like the 
[NYT Upshot](https://www.nytimes.com/section/upshot) section or 
[Flowing Data](https://www.nytimes.com/section/upshot) for ideas on how to 
improve this core capability at Mazama Science.

## _Be honest about which tasks you like and dislike and what you want to learn._

People do their best work when they get into 
[flow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_(psychology)). When you are fully 
engaged in an enjoyable task, time will fly and the software you produce will be
higher quality.
